[**KAPLAY**](https://kaplaydocs.pages.dev/) is a JavaScript library that helps you make games fast and fun!

THIS IS THE DOCUMENTATION for `kaplay@3001.0.0-alpha.7`.

Start playing around with it in the [KAPLAYGROUND](https://kaplay.pages.dev/)

## KAPLAY vs Kaboom.js, what's the difference?

On 21 May 2024 we took the decision to create this spiritual successor of kaboom, being also a fork of it.

This was due to layoffs at replit (creators of Kaboom.js), and among those affected was the original creator of Kaboom. Prior to this the project was pretty much abandoned with no major releases for more than a year.

The idea is to expand what kaboom was under a new identity, kaplay itself is fully compatible with Kaboom.
